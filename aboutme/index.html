    <h2>Rebeca Arredondo</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Rebeca Arredondo, I am 28 years old. I am married and have 3 kids, 2 boys and one girl ages 6,4, and 1 1/2. I am from Guatemala but I am currently living in Portugal.</p>
    <p>One of my hobbies is cooking and baking. During the pandemic, I was looking for something where I could release my stress of being in all day every day in my house and I found this new talent that I did not know I had.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church my whole life. I love that I will be able to know that my family can be together after this life and forever. I love that I am a child of God and that he loves me.</p>
    <p>The thing that I love the most about BYUI is that I get to study online. With small kids in a new country, it has become more difficult to attend an in-person school, and BYUI allows me to do it all from my house. Even better, providing me with a spiritual side in my studies.</p>
